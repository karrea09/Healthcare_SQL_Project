#### Tools and Skills
SQL (MySQL), Database Normalization, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, Data Cleaning, Business Intelligence

#### Project Overview
This project involves designing and analyzing a relational healthcare database using SQL. A flat patient visit dataset was normalized into structured tables including patients, doctors, hospitals, and visits to support insightful analytics and reporting.

#### Key Highlights
Normalized the original dataset into relational tables with proper primary and foreign key relationships across patients, doctors, hospitals, and visits.
Wrote over 25 SQL queries to uncover meaningful insights such as hospital revenue, doctor performance, patient behavior, and billing trends.
Used window functions and conditional logic to analyze visit frequency, patient switching between doctors, and patterns in billing amounts.
Identified top-performing hospital and doctor combinations, seasonal revenue trends, and hospitals with potential for improvement.
Developed clean, modular SQL scripts that support repeatable analysis and flexible reporting without data redundancy.
#### Files Included
healthcare_dataset.csv – Raw dataset
patient_parent.sql, doctor_parent.sql, hospital_parent.sql – Scripts for parent tables
Visits.sql – Main table script with foreign key references
